			sensory: `## Sensory Detail (Score 1-5)


This metric captures the **richness and vividness of the sensory information** you recall from your dream experience. It's about how much detail you remember across your five senses—what you saw, heard, felt, smelled, and tasted. Tracking this helps you gauge the overall immersive quality of your dreams and can indicate improvements in your recall abilities.

| Score        | Description |
| ------------ | ----------- |
| 1 (Minimal)  | You recall little to no sensory information. The dream feels vague and lacks specific sights, sounds, textures, smells, or tastes. It's more of a general impression than a lived experience. |
| 2 (Limited)  | You recall a few basic sensory details, perhaps a dominant color or a general sound. The sensory landscape of the dream is still quite sparse and underdeveloped in your memory. |
| 3 (Moderate) | You recall a noticeable amount of sensory information, often encompassing one or two senses more strongly. You might remember some specific visual elements (like shapes or light), a few distinct sounds (like voices or music), or a general feeling of touch or temperature. |
| 4 (Rich)     | You recall a significant amount of sensory information across multiple senses. You can describe specific visual details, distinct sounds and their qualities, and perhaps a clear smell, taste, or detailed texture. The dream feels quite immersive and multi-dimensional. |
| 5 (Vivid)    | Your recall is exceptionally detailed and encompasses a wide range of intense sensory experiences. You can clearly describe intricate visual scenes with specific colors and light, distinct and numerous sounds, and often specific tastes and smells. The dream feels incredibly real and alive in your memory, almost as if you were truly there. |`,

			emotional: `## Emotional Recall (Score 1-5)


This metric focuses on your **ability to remember and articulate the emotions you experienced while dreaming**. Dreams are often rich with feelings, and tracking them can provide profound insights into your subconscious state, anxieties, joys, and unresolved issues. This metric helps you assess not just _what_ emotions were present, but also their clarity, intensity, and how they evolved throughout the dream narrative.

| Score                | Description |
| -------------------- | ----------- |
| 1 (Vague)            | You have only a faint, undefined sense that you felt _some_ emotion in the dream, but you cannot identify it specifically. It's more of an undifferentiated feeling than a distinct emotion. |
| 2 (General)          | You can identify a primary emotion, broad (e.g., generally happy, generally sad, a sense of fear) but are unable to describe its intensity, specific nuances, or how it might have changed. |
| 3 (Identified)       | You can identify one or two specific emotions you felt during the dream (e.g., excitement, frustration, surprise). You might also be able to describe their general intensity, such as "a little scared" or "very happy." |
| 4 (Nuanced)          | You recall several distinct emotions experienced during the dream. You can describe some of the nuances or shifts in your feelings throughout the dream's narrative (e.g., starting with anxiety, transitioning to relief, then curiosity). |
| 5 (Deep and Complex) | You have a strong and detailed recollection of the emotional landscape of the dream. You can articulate multiple distinct emotions, their precise intensity, and how they interplayed or evolved within the dream's context. The emotional experience feels rich, complex, and clearly remembered. |`,

			lost: `## Lost Segments (Number)



This metric tracks the number of distinct instances where you have a clear feeling or awareness that a part of the dream is missing or has been forgotten. This isn't about omitting fragments you never recalled in the first place. It's about those "gaps" in your recalled narrative where you feel like "there was something else there," or you have a fleeting image or feeling that then vanishes.

If you recall the dream as a complete, seamless narrative with no sense of missing parts, this score would be 0.

If you have a distinct feeling of one or more breaks or missing chunks in the dream's sequence, you would count each of those instances.`,

			descriptive: `## Descriptiveness (Score 1-5)



This metric assesses the **level of detail and elaboration in your written dream capture**. It goes beyond just raw sensory details (which are covered by the "Sensory Detail" metric) to evaluate how thoroughly you describe the events, actions, characters' behaviors, interactions, and the overall narrative flow of your dream. A higher score means your dream entry paints a more complete and vivid picture for yourself or anyone reading it.

| Score                | Description |
| -------------------- | ----------- |
| 1 (Minimal)          | Your dream capture is very brief and outlines only the most basic elements. It lacks significant descriptive language, making it feel like a simple summary or a sparse list of facts rather than a story. |
| 2 (Limited)          | Your capture provides a basic account of the dream's main events and characters, but it lacks significant descriptive detail. You might mention what happened, but not how it happened, who was involved in detail, or the atmosphere of the scene. |
| 3 (Moderate)         | Your dream capture provides a reasonably detailed account of the main events, characters, and their interactions. You use some descriptive language, allowing the reader to get a general sense of the dream's progression and key elements. |
| 4 (Detailed)         | Your capture includes a significant level of descriptive detail, bringing the dream narrative and its elements to life. You elaborate on actions, character behaviors, dialogue (if any), and the unfolding of the plot, creating a richer mental image. |
| 5 (Highly Elaborate) | Your dream capture is exceptionally rich in detail, using vivid and comprehensive language to describe every aspect of the dream. You meticulously capture events, intricate character details, nuanced interactions, and the overall progression of the narrative, making the dream feel fully rendered and immersive. |`,

			confidence: `## Confidence Score (Score 1-5)



This is a **subjective metric reflecting your overall sense of how complete and accurate your dream recall feels** immediately after waking. It gauges your personal certainty about how much of the dream's content, narrative, and details you've managed to retrieve and record. Tracking your confidence can offer insights into the stability of your dream memory and highlight patterns in how thoroughly your dreams are being retained.

| Score         | Description |
| ------------- | ----------- |
| 1 (Very Low)  | You wake up with little to no clear memory, feeling like you've barely scratched the surface of the dream. You have very low confidence that what little you recall is accurate or complete, suspecting a significant portion has been lost. |
| 2 (Low)       | You recall a bit more, but the memory feels fragmented and incomplete. You have low confidence that you've captured the full picture, and there are many fuzzy areas or missing sections you're aware of. |
| 3 (Moderate)  | You feel like you've recalled a fair amount of the dream, perhaps the main storyline or several key scenes. Your confidence is moderate, acknowledging that there might be some details or segments you're unsure about or that remain elusive. |
| 4 (High)      | You feel confident that you've recalled the majority of the dream with a good level of detail and coherence. You have a strong sense of its narrative flow and content, with only minor gaps or uncertainties. |
| 5 (Very High) | You feel extremely confident that you've recalled the entire dream in vivid detail and with strong accuracy. The memory feels robust, complete, and fully accessible, leaving you with no significant sense of missing parts or uncertainty. |`,

			characterRoles: `## Character Roles (Score 1-5)



This metric tracks the **presence and significance of all individuals** (both familiar and unfamiliar) appearing in your dream's narrative. It assesses how central characters are to the dream's events, plot, and overall experience, regardless of whether you recognize them from waking life.

| Score                | Description |
| -------------------- | ----------- |
| 1 (None)             | No familiar characters appear in the dream. |
| 2 (Background)       | Familiar characters appear but only in minor or background roles. |
| 3 (Supporting)       | Familiar characters play supporting roles in the dream narrative. |
| 4 (Major)            | Familiar characters are central to the dream's events or narrative. |
| 5 (Dominant)         | The dream is primarily about or dominated by interactions with familiar characters. |`,

			charactersCount: `## Characters Count (Number)


Represents the total number of characters in your dream. (Automatically calculated as the sum of Familiar Count and Unfamiliar Count.)

**Detailed Description:**

This metric tracks the **total number of distinct individual characters** that appeared in your dream. This includes anyone you perceived as a person, familiar or unfamiliar, or any person-like entity (e.g., a sentient robot, an animal behaving like a human, an identifiable mythological figure). This count provides a quantitative measure of the social density or complexity of your dream, indicating how many distinct individuals populated your dream world.

- **Use:** To track the frequency with which your dreams feature other beings, and to analyze trends in the size of your dream's "cast." A higher count might suggest more complex social processing, while a lower count might point to more solitary or abstract dream experiences.
- **Counting Guidelines:**
    - Count each _distinct_ individual present, even if they only appear briefly.
    - Do not count groups of people unless you specifically discern individual members (e.g., "a crowd" would be 1 unless you remember three distinct people within it, then it's 3).
    - Focus on individuals who are perceived as living, conscious beings within the dream's context.
- **Score:** A direct numerical count (e.g., 0, 1, 2, 5, 10+).`,

			familiarCount: `## Familiar Count (1-100 score)


The number of characters you know from your waking life that appear in the dream. Includes people, pets, or any other familiar beings.

**Detailed Description:**

This metric tracks the **total number of distinct individuals appearing in your dream that you recognize from your waking life**. This includes family members, friends, colleagues, acquaintances, public figures you know, or even pets that play a person-like role and are familiar to you. This count helps to quantify the presence of your real-world social circle within your dreamscape.

- **Use:** To observe the frequency of familiar faces in your dreams. An increase in this count might indicate your mind is actively processing waking-life relationships, social dynamics, or specific interactions with people you know. It can also highlight individuals who are prominent in your subconscious.
- **Counting Guidelines:**
    - Count each _distinct_ familiar individual. If the same person appears multiple times or in different guises but is still recognizable as that one person, count them once.
    - Focus on individuals whom you distinctly recognized as someone from your waking life within the dream.
- **Score:** A direct numerical count (e.g., 0, 1, 2, 5).`,

			unfamiliarCount: `## Unfamiliar Count (1-100 score)


Tracks the number of characters you don't know from your waking life that appear in the dream. Includes strangers, fictional characters, or any other unfamiliar beings.

**Detailed Description:**

This metric tracks the **total number of distinct individuals appearing in your dream whom you do not recognize from your waking life**. These might be faces you've never seen before, composite figures, or archetypal characters (e.g., a wise old stranger, an anonymous crowd member, a fantastical creature behaving like a person). This count helps to quantify the presence of unknown or novel social interactions within your dreamscape.

- **Use:** To observe the frequency of new or unknown characters in your dreams. A higher count might suggest your mind is exploring new social situations, processing aspects of your psyche that aren't tied to known individuals, or engaging with universal themes not directly linked to your personal relationships.
- **Counting Guidelines:**
    - Count each _distinct_ unfamiliar individual. If an unknown person appears multiple times but is clearly the same "stranger," count them once.
    - Focus on individuals who are perceived as living, conscious beings within the dream's context, but for whom you have no waking-life recognition.
- **Score:** A direct numerical count (e.g., 0, 1, 3, 7).`,

			charactersList: `## Characters List


Allows you to list all characters that appeared in your dream.


This metric serves as a **qualitative record of all distinct individual characters** that appeared in your dream. It's a place to note the names (if known), descriptions, and familiar/unfamiliar status of each character, providing rich context to your numerical counts and role scores. This list helps you to specifically identify recurring figures, analyze their characteristics, and provide a detailed roster of your dream's cast.

- **Use:** To complement the "Characters Count," "Familiar Count," and "Unfamiliar Count" by giving you the specific identities of the characters. It allows for deeper qualitative analysis of who (or what kind of entity) is populating your dream world.
- **Content Guidelines:**
    - List each unique character.
    - For familiar characters, use their name or a clear identifier (e.g., "Mom," "Friend Alex," "Coworker Sarah").
    - For unfamiliar characters, provide a brief descriptive identifier (e.g., "Mysterious cloaked figure," "Tall stranger with a hat," "Smiling old woman," "Talking squirrel").
    - Optionally, you can tag them as \`(fam)\` for familiar or \`(unfam)\` for unfamiliar to quickly distinguish them within the list.
- **Example Format within Callout:** \`Characters List: Mom (fam), Friend Alex (fam), Mysterious Man (unfam), Talking Raven (unfam)\`
- **Score:** This metric does not have a numerical score (1-5); it is a list of descriptive entries.`,

			characterClarity: `## Character Clarity/Familiarity (1-5 score)


The distinctness and recognizability of the individual characters (both familiar and unfamiliar) appearing in your dream.


This metric assesses the distinctness and recognizability of the individual characters (both familiar and unfamiliar) appearing in your dream. It focuses on how clearly you perceived their features, identity, or presence. When used in conjunction with the other Characters metrics, this metric adds the dimension of _how well you saw/perceived them_.

| Score                     | Description |
| ------------------------- | ----------- |
| 1 (Indistinct/Absent)     | No characters were recalled, or any perceived characters were entirely formless, shadowy, or too indistinct to even categorize as familiar or unfamiliar. |
| 2 (Vague Presence)        | Characters were present but highly blurred, featureless, or rapidly shifting. You had a sense of their presence but couldn't make out details or their identity clearly. |
| 3 (Partially Discernible) | Characters were somewhat discernible; you might have caught glimpses of features or had a vague sense of their identity (e.g., "a man," "a child") but lacked clear details or certainty. |
| 4 (Clearly Recognized)    | Characters were clearly perceived, and their features/identity were distinct enough to recognize, even if they were unfamiliar. For familiar characters, you recognized them without doubt. |
| 5 (Vivid & Defined)       | Characters appeared with exceptional clarity and detail, almost as if seen in waking life. Their features, expressions, and presence were sharply defined and fully formed in your recall. |`,

			dreamTheme: `## Dream Theme (Categorical/Keywords)


The dominant subjects, ideas, or emotional undercurrents present in your dream.


This metric aims to identify the dominant subjects, ideas, or emotional undercurrents present in your dream. Instead of a numerical score, you will select one or more keywords or categories that best represent the core themes of the dream.

**Possible Categories/Keywords (Examples - User-definable list in plugin recommended):**
- Travel/Journey
- Conflict/Argument
- Learning/Discovery
- Loss/Grief
- Joy/Happiness
- Fear/Anxiety
- Absurdity/Surrealism
- Creativity/Inspiration
- Relationship Dynamics
- Work/Career
- Health/Illness
- Nostalgia/Past
- Technology
- Nature/Environment
- Spiritual/Mystical
- Transformation
- Communication
- Power/Control
- Vulnerability

**Use:** To track recurring patterns in the subject matter and emotional tone of your dreams over time. Identifying themes can provide insights into your subconscious concerns, interests, and emotional processing. You can select multiple themes if a dream has several prominent aspects.`,

			symbolicContent: `## Symbolic Content (Categorical/Keywords)


Note specific objects, figures, actions, or animals in the dream that felt meaningful or symbolic.


This metric helps you identify and track the specific symbols that appear in your dreams. While your Dream Theme might capture the overall subject, Symbolic Content focuses on individual elements like a lion, a red door, or a recurring specific action that seems to carry deeper meaning. This can be recorded as a list of keywords or tags, allowing you to recognize your unique symbolic language and discover recurring motifs over time.`,

			lucidityLevel: `## Lucidity Level (Score 1-5)


Tracks your degree of awareness that you are dreaming while the dream is in progress.


This metric tracks your **degree of awareness that you are dreaming while the dream is in progress**. Lucid dreaming is a state where you know you're in a dream, and this metric helps you monitor how often and how clearly you achieve this awareness. Understanding your lucidity levels can be crucial for those interested in exploring, influencing, or even controlling their dream experiences.

| Score                | Description |
| -------------------- | ----------- |
| 1 (Non-Lucid)        | You have no awareness that you are dreaming. You experience the dream as reality, no matter how bizarre or illogical it may be. |
| 2 (Faint Awareness)  | You experience a fleeting thought or a vague feeling that something in the dream is unusual or dream-like. This awareness doesn't quite solidify into certainty that you are actually dreaming. |
| 3 (Clear Awareness)  | You become clearly aware that you are dreaming. You know you're in a dream, but your ability to control or significantly influence the dream environment, characters, or events might be limited. You primarily function as a conscious observer within the dream. |
| 4 (Moderate Control) | You are aware that you are dreaming and can actively influence some aspects of the dream. This might include changing your own actions or dialogue, altering minor elements of the environment, or gently nudging the dream's narrative in a desired direction. |
| 5 (High Lucidity)    | You have a strong and stable awareness that you are dreaming, combined with a significant degree of control over the dream environment, its characters, and events. You can often perform specific actions, intentionally explore the dream world, or even manifest objects and scenarios at will. |`,

			dreamCoherence: `## Dream Coherence (Score 1-5)


Assesses the logical consistency and narrative flow of your dream.


This metric assesses the **logical consistency and narrative flow of your dream**. It helps you gauge how well the dream's events, characters, and settings connect and make sense within its own internal "logic," even if that logic is surreal by waking standards. Tracking coherence can reveal patterns in your mind's ability to construct stable, unified narratives during sleep.

| Score                   | Description |
| ----------------------- | ----------- |
| 1 (Incoherent)          | The dream is fragmented, disjointed, and nonsensical. Scenes shift abruptly without logical connection, characters and objects may change inexplicably, and the laws of reality are entirely suspended without any discernible internal consistency. |
| 2 (Loosely Connected)   | Some elements or scenes might have a vague or thematic relationship, but the overall narrative lacks a clear and logical progression. Time, space, and causality are often inconsistent, making it hard to follow a consistent story. |
| 3 (Moderately Coherent) | The dream has a discernible narrative thread, but it may contain noticeable illogical elements, inconsistencies in character behavior or setting, or sudden, unexplained shifts in the storyline that disrupt the flow. |
| 4 (Mostly Coherent)     | The dream generally follows a logical progression with a relatively consistent narrative, characters, and settings. Any illogical elements are minor or don't significantly disrupt the overall sense of a somewhat realistic (albeit dreamlike) experience. |
| 5 (Highly Coherent)     | The dream feels like a consistent and logical experience, even if the content is surreal or fantastical. There's a clear flow of events, consistent character behavior (within the dream's own rules), and a strong sense of internal consistency in the dream's reality, making it feel like a complete story. |`,

			environmentalFamiliarity: `## Environmental Familiarity (Score 1-5)


Tracks the degree to which the locations and environments in your dream are recognizable from your waking life.


This metric assesses the degree to which the locations and environments within your dream are **recognizable or familiar from your waking life**. It helps you track whether your dreams place you in known surroundings, completely novel landscapes, or a mix of both. Understanding the familiarity of your dream settings can offer insights into how your mind processes daily experiences and explores unknown territories during sleep.

| Score                     | Description |
| ------------------------- | ----------- |
| 1 (Completely Unfamiliar) | All the settings in the dream are entirely novel and have no discernible connection to any places you have experienced in your waking life. |
| 2 (Vaguely Familiar)      | You experience a sense of déjà vu or a faint feeling of having been in a similar place before, but you cannot specifically identify the location or its connection to your waking memories. |
| 3 (Partially Familiar)    | The dream settings are a blend of recognizable and unfamiliar elements. You might recognize the layout of a room but find it in a completely new building, or a familiar landscape might have strange, uncharacteristic features. |
| 4 (Mostly Familiar)       | The dream primarily takes place in locations you know from your waking life, such as your home, workplace, or familiar landmarks, although there might be minor alterations or unusual juxtapositions. |
| 5 (Completely Familiar)   | All the settings in the dream are direct and accurate representations of places you know well from your waking experience, without any significant alterations or unfamiliar elements. |`,

			timeDistortion: `## Time Distortion (Score 1-5)


Rate how unusually time behaved in the dream's narrative.


Time Distortion assesses the surreal nature of time's flow within your dream. Unlike waking life, dream time can speed up, slow down, jump abruptly, or even have events happening simultaneously. This 1-5 scale helps you quantify how linear or chaotic the passage of time felt, offering insights into how your mind processes temporal experiences in different dream states.

| Score              | Description |
| ------------------ | ----------- |
| 1 (Normal) | Time flows linearly, as in waking life. |
| 2 (Minor Fluctuations) | Slight jumps or skips, but generally linear. |
| 3 (Noticeable Distortion) | Time speeds up/slows down significantly, or small jumps. |
| 4 (Significant Distortion) | Time shifts abruptly, jumps backward/forward, or multiple events feel simultaneous. |
| 5 (Chaotic/Non-Existent) | Time has no discernible order; events happen out of sequence or simultaneously without any linear progression. |`,

			easeOfRecall: `## Ease of Recall (Score 1-5)


Assesses how readily and effortlessly you can remember the dream upon waking.


This metric assesses **how readily and effortlessly you could remember the dream upon waking**. It measures the immediate accessibility of the dream content, from fleeting impressions to vivid, detailed narratives. Tracking your ease of recall can help you identify trends in your dream memory and gauge the effectiveness of recall-boosting practices.

| Score              | Description |
| ------------------ | ----------- |
| 1 (Very Difficult) | You woke up with little to no memory of having dreamed. Recalling even a single fragment required significant mental effort, and you only managed to grasp fleeting impressions or feelings. |
| 2 (Difficult)      | You remembered a few isolated images, emotions, or very brief snippets of the dream, but the overall narrative was elusive and very hard to piece together, requiring considerable struggle. |
| 3 (Moderate)       | You could recall the basic outline or a few key scenes of the dream with a reasonable amount of effort. Some details might have been hazy or forgotten, but the core of the dream was accessible with focused concentration. |
| 4 (Easy)           | You remembered the dream relatively clearly and could recount a significant portion of the narrative and details without much difficulty. The recall felt relatively immediate and accessible upon waking. |
| 5 (Very Easy)      | The dream was vividly and immediately present in your memory upon waking. You could recall intricate details and the flow of events with little to no effort, almost as if the experience had just happened in waking life. |`,

			recallStability: `## Recall Stability (Score 1-5)


Assesses how well your memory of the dream holds up in the minutes immediately following waking.


This metric assesses **how well your memory of the dream holds up and remains consistent in the minutes and hours immediately following waking**. It measures the resilience of your dream recall against the natural process of forgetting. Tracking recall stability can help you understand if your current dream capture methods are sufficient to preserve details before they fade, and highlight whether certain dreams are inherently more "sticky" than others.

| Score                  | Description |
| ---------------------- | ----------- |
| 1 (Rapidly Fading)     | The dream memory begins to dissipate almost instantly upon waking. Details vanish quickly, and within a short time (e.g., a few minutes), only a faint impression or a single image might remain. |
| 2 (Significant Fading) | You can recall a fair amount initially, but key details and the overall narrative structure fade noticeably within the first 10-15 minutes after waking, making it difficult to reconstruct the full dream later. |
| 3 (Moderate Fading)    | Some details and less significant parts of the dream might fade within the first 15-30 minutes, but the core narrative and key events remain relatively intact. |
| 4 (Mostly Stable)      | Your recall of the dream remains largely consistent for at least 30 minutes after waking. Only minor details or less impactful elements might fade over time. |
| 5 (Very Stable)        | The memory of the dream feels solid and enduring in the immediate post-waking period. You can recall details consistently even after a longer period without actively trying to remember it. |`,
